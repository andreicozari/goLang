/*
A newly minted goroutine is given a few kilobytes, which is almost always
enough. When it isnâ€™t, the run-time grows (and shrinks) the memory for
storing the stack automatically, allowing many goroutines to live in a
modest amount of memory. The CPU overhead averages about three cheap
instructions per function call. It is practical to create hundreds of thousands
of goroutines in the same address space. If goroutines were just threads,
system resources would run out at a much smaller number.
