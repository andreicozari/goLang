/*
	A newly minted goroutine is given a few kilobytes, which is almost always
	enough. When it isnâ€™t, the run-time grows (and shrinks) the memory for
	storing the stack automatically, allowing many goroutines to live in a
	modest amount of memory. The CPU overhead averages about three cheap
	instructions per function call. It is practical to create hundreds of thousands
	of goroutines in the same address space. If goroutines were just threads,
	system resources would run out at a much smaller number.

	1e = 10
	1e4 = 10 at power 4 = 10 * 4 = 1000
	If you create 1000 goR -> it takes les than 1Mb memory per total.

	Application context switching - communication between two goroutines ==> is much much cheaper,
	  than the Operating System context switching.
